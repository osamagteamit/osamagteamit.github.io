Amongst all the Morocco cities to visitIron Age burials, in the Kerameikos and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900 BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region.[35] The leading position of Athens may well have resulted from its central location in the Greek world, its secure stronghold on the Acropolis and its access to the sea, which gave it a natural advantage over inland rivals such as Thebes and SpartaAthens sprawls across the central plain of Attica that is often referred to as the Athens Basin or the Attica Basin (Greek: Λεκανοπέδιο Αθηνών/Αττικής). The basin is bounded by four large mountains: Mount Aigaleo to the west, Mount Parnitha to the north, Mount Pentelicus to the northeast and Mount Hymettus to the eas. </p>

            <h2>Moments In Morocco</h2>
            <p class="moment">
                Trekking in Saghro Mountains: Have you ever imagined walking for 5 or 6 days into the wild? Camping in the mountain, drinking tea with nomadic people or staying in some local people house for the night? Trekking in Morocco is a fantastic experience and you should plan to do it if you wish to have one of those one of a kind life experiences. Check out Ichou le Berbere for interesting Morocco mountain trekking,El Jadida Cistern: For a place of mystic feelings and mysterious ambiance, for sure El Jadida 16th century water cistern is the place to visit. Try not to visit the cistern when big groups or excursions are also visiting. Preferable to wait and explore in a calmer ambiance.

                Like any other place in the world, Morocco is made of special sites, unique locations and special moments where you can indulge yourself in one of a kind experiences. Best Moroccan moments are spread a bit around the vast country, and the vast majority are connected either to Morocco’s calm atmosphere or sun sets associated with beautiful landscapes. On this page I will make a list of Moroccan best moments (if somehow this is possible since moments depend on each person).

Sun set in Erg Chebbi Dunes: This is one of Morocco’s best sun sets where you blend amazing orange dunes, with magnificent surrounding landscapes. Erg Chebbi Dunes are located in southeast Morocco right close to the Algerian border. Most well known villages around the dunes are Merzouga, Hassilabied and Khamlia the village of Khamlia with the unique tribe of the Bambaras also called Gnawas, Moroccan descendants of slaves from Africa that settled down in the region. Check out Auberge du Sud for a great Merzouga Hotel and camel trekking in Morocco.
